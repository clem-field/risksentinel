                    <li><b>all-MiniLM-L12-v2</b> - A fast and lightweight (12 layers). Great for quick testing, but less accurate on complex queries.</li>
                    <li ><b>all-mpnet-base-v2</b> - For balanced performance and speed. Strong general-purpose model, recommended for most use cases.</li>
                    <li><b>multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1</b> - Optimized for question-answering (6 layers). Fast, but may miss nuanced relationships.</li>
                    <li><b>all-distilroberta-v1</b> - A distilled RoBERTa model. Good accuracy, slower than MiniLM, but better for detailed text.</li>
                    <li><b>paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2</b> - A lightweight (6 layers), excels at paraphrasing. Fast, but less robust for technical queries.</li>
                    <li><b>all-roberta-large-v1</b> - Higher accuracy, large model. Best for complex queries, but slowest and memory-intensive.</li>
